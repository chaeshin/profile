        <h4>about me</h4>
        <p>
          I worked as an architectural designer until recently. I went into the field because of the design aspect of the work, and I've witnessed a growing usage of programming skills with many CAD applications in the field, which made me curious about programming languages. This change in the creative field piqued my interest in learning web development, recognizing it as a gateway to new creative possibilities, or working for a firm that uses more up-to-date technology for the design field. I believe that knowing programming languages will help me understand not only developments in the design field, but also open up doors to new careers in software engineering.
